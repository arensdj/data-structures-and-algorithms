# Reverse an Array
# This program prompts a user for an array of arguments and returns an array with the elements 
# in reversed order

## Challenge
# Code an algorithm that will reverse the array elements without using built-in methods

## Approach & Efficiency
# The approach I took was to write a function that takes an array of elements as an argument.  
# In a while loop, iterate through the input array starting at the end.  Append each element
# to a local array until all elements of input array is appended.  The local array is 
# returned.  The Big O space/time is O(N).  There are two steps in the algorithm.  The
# performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
