# Singly Linked List
# The purpose of this program is to provide a linked list class and a node class that will be used to 
# create a sequence of Node objects that are connected/linked to each other. 

## Challenge
# The challenge was understanding what a linked list data structure is and how to add values 
# into it.  Each value added needs to be able to reference the next value in the linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency
# Define two separate classes: a LinkedList and a Node class.
# The Node class will contain the value being added to the linked list.  It also must have a property
# that references the next Node object in the linked list.
# The LinkedList class contains a property that points to the head which is the front of a linked
# list.  To create a sequence of Node objects, the LinkedList class needs a method to insert a Node
# object into the linked list.  To connect each Node object, a property in the Node object must
# reference the next Node object contained in the linked list.
