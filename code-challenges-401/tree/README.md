# Trees
# This is a Binary Tree data structure in which each node has at 
# most two child nodes which are referred to as the left child 
# and the right child.

## Challenge
# The challenge was understanding how to add a new value into the tree.  The
# first value is the root node.  All subsequent values added will be done by
# comparing the new value to the value of the root node.  If value is less
# than the root node value, the new value get added to the left child.  Otherwise,
# the new value gets added to the right child.  Also, the traversal of the tree
# is tricky.  Preorder, inorder and postorder have a particular sequence.  Each of
# them are clearly explained in the docstring.

## Approach & Efficiency
# Used a recursive routine was used when traversing the binary tree to produce
# a particular traversal order and when checking if a particular value exists
# in the binary tree.

## API
# None
