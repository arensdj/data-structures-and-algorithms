# Array Shift
# This program takes an input array and a value and inserts that value in the middle 
# of the array.

## Challenge
# Find the middle of the input array for odd and even elements and insert input value.      

## Approach & Efficiency
# Computed the middle of the array using floor division.  If the input array contains even
# number elements, the exact position to insert the input value is the number of array
# elements divided by two.  If input array has odd number of elements, the exact position to 
# insert the input value is the middle of the array plus one.  A new array is created to
# contain the input array with the input value inserted in the middle.
